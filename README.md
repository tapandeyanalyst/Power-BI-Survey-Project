# Power BI Survey Project

**Description:** A survey was conducted to gain insights into the current landscape of data professionals and understand how they are aligning with market trends. The goal was to capture a comprehensive view of their roles, skills, tools in use, career growth, and challenges faced in the evolving data ecosystem. This information aims to help organizations, recruiters, and professionals themselves better navigate the rapidly changing data industry.
